title: Anonymous report sharing
---
If you ever need to share a report with someone without the application credentials, you can create a special link to share the performance report with anyone without the need of having an account.

1. Open a report you want to share
2. Click on the hamburger icon in the top right corner of the page
3. Click **Share**
4. Click **Add new link**
5. Fill the description and click **Submit**

Now you can share the link with anyone. The link will be valid forever.
If you ever need to revoke the link, you can simply delete it from the list.

:::note
The application also allows you to generate this special link automatically upon report processing.
This can be done via scenario settings, and the link will be returned by the API.

You can leverage this feature to share the report from you CI/CD pipeline automatically.
