### How do you approach performance engineering within your organization?
On a recent project, my goal was to execute performance tests against a web application on a per-release basis.
The performance test results for each release would then be compared to ensure that the changes made to the underlying infrastructure
and code did not introduce performance regressions and/or defects. 
Due to limited time availability and budget constraints, Apache JMeter was chosen as the tool to be used to generate load using test scripts. 
As many performance engineers will know, JMeter is a very powerful tool, but the out-of-the-box HTML report leaves a lot to be desired.

### Why did you decide to start using JtlReporter?
After further investigation and experimenting with various test reporting options including BlazeMeter, I discovered JtlReporter, 
a free and open-source test reporting solution developed by Ludek Novy which is being used by companies including Red Hat and Wunderman Thompson.

### Can you provide an example of improvements achieved with JtlReporter?
Features including detailed and customizable performance test results reports, test execution comparisons and trends, performance regression alerts, and the ability to share performance test reports with anyone proved extremely useful, and based on my experience would be my recommendation for the test reporting tool to use for any JMeter load and performance tests.

### What are the features of JtlReporter that you like the most?
If you’re looking for a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-use solution to assist with the critical analysis and improvement recommendation stages of a performance testing project, 
I’d highly recommend taking a look at JtlReporter.
